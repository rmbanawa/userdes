									typical type of introducing yourself in the
									front of class but we introduced our self by creating a Trello account and other
									type of website that will
									help us in class. About the telling of our favorite application, each one of us have
									different application, it
									depends on our daily activities or what we have liked to do. Now, I have new ideas
									in the application
									that they shared and maybe I will install it because somehow it is useful for me. We
									also talked about
									design, we shared different meaning about design. For me, design is not only to make
									things look good,
									appealing or for its usability rather it should have a purpose and should have deep
									meaning to the users.</p>

								<p class="first-letra">What I have learned in Need Finding and paper prototyping, while
									we are collaborating to each
									other and brainstorming about the app that we need to develop, it is important to
									find a
									problem first before going to the solution without knowing the problem. The problem
									within
									our group, we find the solution first, that is why we have problem in presenting our
									idea. The
									app the we will develop is a hospital finder, which user can find the nearest
									hospital and the
									vacancy of every hospital, if its full or not.</p>

										In making my first web application in User Design class, for me, I did not find it difficult because
										I’ve already been making a web application when I was in Senior High in APC. They taught me basic
										JavaScript programming, database system and bootstrap, that is why I didn’t have any issue in making
										my web application. But still, I need to learn more about making a web application because technology
										evolved so fast, and it is important the we learn new technology.
								</p>
								<p class="first-letra">
										This is my first time using Heroku and using a GitHub repository, it is useful for web developer to
										test their static HTML web pages and I can view my application through Heroku app. Still, I need to
										improve my design, add some navigation, proper color, typography and put some images. In order to
										make a good web application, it should be easy to understand and user-friendly because you’re not the
										only one who will access your website, in the future it can be your customers, or it depends on your
										audience.
								</p>
								<p class="first-letra">
										Overall, it is fun, and I enjoy making my web application because it helps me to recall my
										knowledge about web development.

									</h2>

										<span class="category"><a><i ></i> REFLECTION # 4</a> <a class="posted-by"><i class="icon-user2"></i> by
											Rovyyc</a></span>
									<p class="first-letra">I thought our quiz would be a typical quiz like other subjects, when I opened the userinyerface
											website, I don’t know how it works or the mechanics of the game. Then I understand that this quiz is like
											a puzzle that you need to solve to go to another level. The technic in this quiz is you need to read the
											instructions and use your logic to solve the problem. In my first attempt, I’ve finished the quiz in six
											minutes and nine seconds, which is not bad because some of my classmates finished it in 10 minutes
											above.</p>
											<p>Since our class is all about user interface, I learned that we have to design our interface properly
											and make it simple so that the user will not have a problem in using your application, just like what
											happened to me, I got frustrated in userinyerface because I don’t what should I clicked and it keeps
											having an error. So, the moral lesson in this quiz is we should create a good user interface so that the
											users can properly use the application.</p>

									<p class="first-letra">My experience in SoCIT Fest was good because I learned a lot during the seminars, and I
											commend the different organization for having an informative seminar about IT. The seminar that I’ve
											been attending are out, Cloud Computing: Microsoft Azure, Data Analytics, etc. One of my favorite
											seminars is the talk about Microsoft HoloLens, because that technology is very helpful for different
											industries like after surgery, architecture, and car manufacturing. I wish I could have that HoloLens in
											the future.</p>
									<p>My role in the success of the event, I attended the seminar to support the different SoCIT
											organization. I also participate in an event of JPCS which UI Design Contest, unfortunately we didn’t win
											the contest but at least we try our best. The goal is to make a new interface with APC website.</p>
									<p>What could we improve on? They should improve promoting their events because sometimes
											they have few participants in their events. Make sure that there will be participants in every event that
											they will organize. My expectation in next SoCIT Fest, more seminars and all of the SoCIT students
											should participate and support the event.</p>

											<span class="category"><a><i ></i> REFLECTION # 6</a> <a class="posted-by"><i class="icon-user2"></i> by
												Rovyyc</a></span>
										<p class="first-letra">In the first half of USERDES class was fine, although we have many activities, reflection every
												week, and projects to finish. As of now, I learned a lot, especially in making an interface before I just
												develop as long as the app run and working it’s fine with me without considering the design and
												interface. Now, I learned that the user interface has an important role in making a project not just in app
												because some people will use it and it should be user-friendly in order to use it with different kinds of
												people.</p>
										<p>The only challenge that I’ve encountered so far is the amount of task we need to finish. Time
												management is very important in order to finish a different task because of it, I managed to pass all
												requirements. Also, Because I have a background in web development, I felt it was easy for me and
												that’s why I didn’t have any problem during the developing of personal website. I was chilling because I
												don’t want to stress myself in school activities, the more you feel comfortable in doing the task, the
												more you can finish it faster.</p>
										<p>My expectation on finals, more lessons and technique on making a good user interface and
												upgrading personal website. Things that we can work on, the android studio making of layout, especially
												about the constraint and relative thing, I don’t know how it works.</p>
